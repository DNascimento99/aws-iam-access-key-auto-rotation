To all application owners,<br>
<br>
Security is the top-most priority of any organization. To ensure continued success in our drive to design and architect a secure infrastructure, we are implementing a 90-day automatic rotation of all AWS IAM User Access Keys. This will begin on [DATE HERE].<br>
<br>
Why is this important and how does fixing this help you?<br>
Rotating Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials periodically will significantly reduce the chances that a compromised set of access keys can be used without your knowledge to access certain components within your AWS account.<br>
<br>
What this means for you:<br>
You will need to update your applications every 90-days with the new Access Key pair. These can be found in AWS Secrets Manager in a secret accessible by your applicationâ€™s AWS IAM User only. You will have a grace period of 10 days after rotation before old Access Keys are disabled. There will be another 10-day grace period before old Access Keys are deleted. Until they are disabled, old Access Keys can be used to programmatically retrieve the new Access Keys from AWS Secrets Manager.<br>
<br>
Enabling this setting will also help you align with the following compliance standards:<br>

&bull; APRA<br>
&bull; MAS<br>
&bull; National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)<br>
&bull; AWS Well-Architected Framework<br>

AWS IAM Access Keys have been rotated for the below:<br>
